This program is the algorithm used to select winners for the Banano Lottery drawings. I'm providing the algorithm to ensure transparency for all entrants.

## Checksums
To ensure integrity of the drawings, I will be running checksums before each drawing of the python scripts so that you can be sure that no files were altered before execution.

If you would like to run a checksum on the files yourself just issue the follow command:

`sha256sum file_name`

### wallet_api.py Checksum

The output for the wallet_api.py should read:

`86a1d75b1d6956445c087b5ac858f89ac2318c06e18a599e6591467f4a784686  wallet_api.py`

### main.py Checksum

The output for the main.py should read:

`3c514547e52e9e21ff93faef772b7b07d35de5fef7c5b92fbaa23638b93b9420  main.py`
