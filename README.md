This program is the algorithm used to select winners for the Banano Lottery drawings. I'm providing the algorithm to ensure transparency for all entrants.

## Checksums
To ensure integrity of the drawings, I will be running checksums of the python scripts before each drawing so that you can be sure that no files were altered before execution.

### Why do I care about the checksums?
If you know the checksum of the original file, you can run a checksum or hashing utility on it. If the resulting checksum matches, you know the file you have is identical.

### How to calculate a checksum on Linux
If you would like to run a checksum on the files yourself just issue the follow command in a terminal:

`sha256sum file_name`

### How to calculate a checksum on Windows
Best I can do is a link:

### wallet_api.py Checksum
The output for the wallet_api.py should read:

`9e57f789c0867b4d26e1f15a0671c8b7d3f9d488aa26cb856608a27fe79beb2f  wallet_api.py`

### main.py Checksum
The output for the main.py should read:

`3124f7e0d942969df743f992ee7dfa7f817937b1199a93503a7444cdc9c76820  main.py`

### specialDrawing.py Checksum
`4fd469f0b39990097e8feb044c3a9e85c32278f86c90a4c5f688cdcf82780a5a  specialDrawing.py`

## Would you like to help?
### Designer Monkeys
I could use some help with a logo. I do not have an eye for design.

### Code Monkeys
I will admit, I am very new to python and I'm not the best python guy. If you have any expertise and would like to clean some things up, I will take all the help I can get. Please be gentle on the code reviews boss. The main reason the code was not published at launch is because having experienced people read my code feels like being seen naked. I am willing to bear the shame if it brings confidence to the game.

### Fat Wallet Monkeys
If you like the project, you can donate some 'nanners.
