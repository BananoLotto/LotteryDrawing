This program is the algorithm used to select winners for the Banano Lottery drawings.

## Checksums
To ensure integrity of the drawings, I will be running checksums before each drawing of the python scripts so that you can be sure that no files were altered before execution.

If you would like to run a checksum on the files yourself just issue the follow command:

`sha256sum file_name`

### wallet_api.py Checksum

The output for the settings.py should read:

`e1c9e71a74339d1aeaf880e4c7a1f20940020912b07e56df78e92adda15f9684  wallet_api.py`
